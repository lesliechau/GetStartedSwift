#Begin with a Starter

In this step you will prepare your project and application.

Navigate to a new directory and run the following command in terminal or command shell:

    bx dev create <MyProject> -p Web -l swift

This command prepares a basic Kitura web server application that is ready to be deployed to the cloud. The application is managed in a Project on Bluemix where you can add additonal cloud services such as Cloudant and App-ID. Learn more about Projects.

Starters are production-ready starter applications that follow Cloud Native architecture Patterns and best practices. Learn more about Starters and Patterns.

Next, run the following command in terminal or command shell to get the code:

    bx dev code <MyProject>

This command downloads the production-ready Starter code to your directory.
